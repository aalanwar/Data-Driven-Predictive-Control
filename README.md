We present a robust data-driven control scheme for unknown linear systems with a bounded process and measurement noise. Instead of depending on a system model as in traditional predictive control, a controller utilizing a data-driven reachable region is proposed. The data-driven reachable regions are based on a matrix zonotope recursion and are computed based on only noisy input-output data of the system's trajectory. We assume measurement and process noise which are contained in bounded sets. While we assume knowledge of these bounds, no knowledge about the statistical properties of the noise is assumed. Our proposed scheme guarantees robust constraint satisfaction under measurement and process noise, which is essential in safety-critical applications.<br />

We present a robust data-driven predictive control approach for unknown nonlinear systems in the presence of bounded process and measurement noise. By using the past noisy input-output data in the learning phase, we propose a novel method to over-approximate reachable sets of an unknown nonlinear system. Then, we propose a data-driven predictive control approach to compute safe and robust control policies from noisy online data. The constraints are guaranteed in the control phase with robust safety margins through the effective use of the predicted output reachable set obtained in the learning phase.   <br />
